**Why this repo is having a custom local configuration for Emacs and Org mode?**

- *Work safely:* Your local configuration affects only your current project, not your entire Emacs setup. It's like
  having a separate set of rules just for this project.

- *Easy recovery:* If your configuration causes problems, you can quickly restore it from your project's Git
  repository. It's like having a backup plan ready to go.

- *Setup custom snippets:* You can easily add your own shortcuts and tools tailored to your needs, making it easier to
  follow along with this tutorial and speeding up your work.
